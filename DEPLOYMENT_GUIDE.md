## 🎯 Next Steps to Get Started

### 1. Configure Email Settings (REQUIRED)
1. Open the web app: http://localhost:8501
2. Go to "⚙️ Email Settings" in the sidebar
3. Enter your Gmail address
4. Generate a Gmail App Password:
   - Go to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
   - Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Generate password for "Mail"
   - Enter the 16-character password
5. Test the configuration with a test email

### 2. Review Sample Reminders
1. Go to "🏠 Dashboard" to see overview
2. Check "📋 Manage Reminders" to view all sample data
3. Edit or delete sample reminders as needed

### 3. Add Your Real Reminders
1. Go to "➕ Add Reminder"
2. Add your actual payment reminders with:
   - Contact details
   - Due dates (set to specific day of month for monthly recurring)
   - Custom reminder messages

### 4. Test Manual Sending
1. Go to "📤 Send Now"
2. Send a test reminder to verify everything works
3. Check your email logs

## 🔄 Running the System

### Option 1: Easy Startup (Recommended)
Double-click: **start_reminder_system.bat**

### Option 2: Manual Startup
```bash
# Start web app only
python -m streamlit run app.py

# Start background scheduler only
python scheduler.py

# Start both (recommended)
python start_app.py
```

### Option 3: Production Setup
For continuous operation:
1. Run the scheduler as a Windows service
2. Set up the web app on a server
3. Use task scheduler for automatic startup

## 📊 How It Works

### Automatic Operation
- **Daily at 9:00 AM**: Checks for due reminders and sends emails
- **Monthly on 1st at 9:30 AM**: Creates next month's recurring reminders
- **Continuous**: Web interface available 24/7

### Manual Operation
- Add/edit/delete reminders through web interface
- Send immediate reminders manually
- Monitor dashboard for upcoming payments

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Change Email Schedule
Edit `scheduler.py`:
```python
# Change reminder time
schedule.every().day.at("09:00").do(check_and_send_reminders)

# Change recurring creation time
schedule.every().day.at("09:30").do(check_monthly_recurring)
```

### Customize Email Template
Edit both `app.py` and `scheduler.py`:
```python
subject = f"Payment Reminder - {row['Agreement Name']}"
body = f"Dear {row['Name']},\n\n{row['Message']}\n\nRegards,\nYour Company Name"
```

### Add More Reminder Fields
Modify the Excel structure and update the code to include:
- Payment amounts
- Payment methods
- Late fees
- Contact phone numbers
